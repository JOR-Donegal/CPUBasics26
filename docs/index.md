# Introduction

!!! abstract "Background to General Computing"

My notes do not have prerequisites, you may not have previously studied computer architecture, or programming. You may not have any theoretical background in operating systems. I intend to lightly cover these topics here. This material is not examinable, it is intended to cover gaps in the basics.

Assisted computation has existed at least from the time of the abacus, but until the era around the second world war, the utility of devices was restricted by the available technologies [1]. This did not prevent advances in the underlying mathematics; names like Boole, Babbage, Lovelace, Napier, Turing, Shannon and Von Neuman are known even to the public and no further examination of their contributions will be made here. From the twentieth century, there was a rapid development in the technologies used for data communications, data storage and processing. Mechanical technologies were used for computing and automation, with relays (an electrical switches) being common in both. Mechanical computing gave way to the first generation of electronic computers based on vacuum tubes or thermionic valves [2]. Preventive maintenance schemes were developed on an ad-hoc basis to keep these valve systems operational, and the first generation of commercial computers were delivered in the early 1950s.

The development of solid-state devices such as the transistor in 1947 [3] led to the second generation of computing technology. Transistors were smaller and required less power and as manufacturing techniques improved, so did individual component service lifetime. Military specification transistors may have had mean time between failure (MTBF) of >10^9 hours at 50⁰C and this figure of 10^9 hours for transistors still shows in many textbooks as a rule of thumb. By the early 1950s, the first transistor computers were being developed at the University of Manchester [4] and commercial computers were introduced in the late 1950s. These were mainframes and (much later models) are still found today in banking, insurance and large-scale manufacturing.

As early as 1949, Werner Jacobi of Siemens AG filed a patent [5] for an amplifier with three transistors, the first integrated circuit (IC). Later work by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments [6] created an integrated oscillator circuit; Kilby was awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 2000 for his contributions. If ICs were produced at volume, the cost per transistor, size and power utilization all dropped, but so did circuit complexity and assembly effort. The introduction of ICs is typically used to define the third generation of computing hardware in the 1960s. Minicomputers emerged and became ubiquitous in even small universities. This availability of computers led to an increase in the pace of development across many related fields. I first worked on an Apple II around 1978! As each new generation of computer emerged (VIC20, Commodore 64, Spectrum) I learned a little bit more. My first work with mini-computers was with Honeywell Level 6 minicomputers; the Central Processing Unit (CPU) was a pizza-box sized motherboard using ICs. The OS was configured using automation (!) and was built using a Multics mainframe.

The ubiquity of computers is something that only emerged in the past generation, and I would argue that the entire field remains immature, we have much to learn.
